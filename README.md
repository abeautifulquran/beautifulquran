# beautifulquran - I bear witness that there is no existance besides the TRUTH.  I am a witness to THE TRUTH.
# Insha ALLAH let their be light here.  Come together for the mutual propogation of DAR UL ISLAM (JARUSALEM)
# That the universe itself should be a house of peace, and that the quran is of NO PRIVATE INTERPRETATION
# That the messenger(s) who brought the truth and who testified to this, be held IN HONOR and that we be accepted for this mighty TASK before ALLAH
# That there be no compulstion in religion, neither should their be any one group of scholars who oppress another
# That there be no people who are unjustly treated wronged or oppressed even by the fact that the QURAN has been received amongst us and is taught to all mankind by the angels themselves in their own language of symbols signs and arithmetic through science and culture.
# That there be no contention amongst us. May the greatest amongst us be the CHILDREN who teach and learn through peace and cooperation. And that their is no racism and injustice through the land(s).
NOW THEREFORE WITNESS THAT I HAVE BEGUN THIS DUTY THAT IS ENJOINED UPON EVERY STUDENT OF EACH SCHOLAR AND EVERY SCHOLAR OF EACH STUDENT. THE LIGHT OF THE QURAN

Line by Line Verse by Verse, Precept upon Precept.  a Open Source, proof.
We are invited to particpate in the recitation of the QURAN according to our understanding of proper iman, and the study of tafsir ul hadith and tafsir ul quran.
# Allah will reward programmers of database and writers of code to enjoin here, the conversations and topics are for the university to study, so please enjoin yourselves unto this project and contribute to it.
# the goal is the distribution of a mighty referrence for the quran in AYAT BY AYAT tone. for Every verse there are other verses which are a proof. For every science their are videos, and concepts which are of science to prove.  Even every verse for every single drop of rain are angels, and every leaf on every tree of life is angels and these are called miracles or signs, so let the science proof be taken and let it become a part of the datasource and database.
You may do what you will if ALLAH has inspired you here. There is no one who will stop ALLAHS will from being done, and no one can do anything unless ALLAH wills.

Insha ALLAH may it be accepted.

I have recieved from my scholar the book ; a study of the quran and tafsir which is reported to me to have been passed down from the familiy of faatimah during the time which she was exiled by the khwarij, insha ALLAH I have put it here even though right now My life is in danger and I do not know when or if I will finish.  At this time I am in fear that if my life is taken that I will not be pleasing to ALLAH because I was made to understand that this was a topic that was not going to be accepted by the ummah for a long time until after dAJJAL appears. THe family of FAATIMAH and all of the secrets which were lost were not lost but they were certainly hidden, and I will not go into the most of what my scholar left me here.

I am an authentic student of the HANAFI fiq. I received authentic study of the path of the true salaf by way of my MAWLANA SHAYKH, SAYYID, and I will transmit accordingly to what is left inshaALLAH ..

I would ask that if their are difference in opinion that these are cited and per way of referrence, the name of the datasource is BURHAN. that is, it is the right of the scholars to proceed to disclose a matter, but it is not the right of the scholars to mislead or to not take responsiblity for what they have obmitted.  As it states  " if a scholar causes the student to err, it is the fault not of the student but of the scholar."
